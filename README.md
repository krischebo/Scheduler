Welcome to the Scheduler!

This repository documents my progress in creating an automated scheduling system. I am coding it from scratch to schedule the 22 students I supervise at a dormitory hall desk into 63 available time slots throughout the week.

Currently, Version #1 is in use, which utilizes a recursive formula. However, it is quite slow.
